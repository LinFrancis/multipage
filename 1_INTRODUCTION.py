It aims to increase resilience for four billion people living in vulnerable communities in collaboration with partner organizations from around the world while developing tools to support them in their work. The Campaign has developed a people-centred resilience Metrics Framework for non-state actors to report climate resilience actions and to quantify and validate their impact under a common framework. This framework will be opened to public consultation at COP27.</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify;">The Metrics Framework pursues several objectives at once, playing an essential function for both the Campaign and the global climate action and resilience communities. The Framework is the cornerstone of the R2R Campaign, serving as a guide for partners in taking action and for the HLC Team on how to manage and foster their work. It is composed of two complementary sets of metrics: Quantitative or Magnitude Metrics help estimate the effect size of the impact, fundamentally through the number of beneficiaries reached, and Qualitative or Depth Metrics, which help understand how the partners and their members are contributing to increasing resilience of people vulnerable to climate change, by observing on which key conditions (Resilience Attributes) are they making a change.</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
